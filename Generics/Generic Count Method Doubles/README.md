<h1>	Generic Count Method Doubles</h1>
Use the description of the previous problem but now, test your list of generic boxes with doubles.

"Create a method that receives as an argument a list of any type that can be compared and an element of the given type. The method should return the count of the elements that are greater than the value of the given element. Modify your Box class to support comparison by value of the stored data.
On the first line, you will receive n - the number of elements to add to the list. On the next n lines, you will receive the actual elements. On the last line, you will get the value of the element to which you need to compare every element in the list.
