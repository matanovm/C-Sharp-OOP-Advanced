<h1>	Generic Swap Method Integers</h1>
Use the description of the previous problem but now, test your list of generic boxes with Integers.

"Create a generic method that receives a list, containing any type of data and swaps the elements at two given indexes.
As in the previous problems read n number of boxes of type String and add them to the list. On the next line, however you will receive a swap command consisting of two indexes. Use the method you've created to swap the elements that correspond to the given indexes and print each element in the list.
