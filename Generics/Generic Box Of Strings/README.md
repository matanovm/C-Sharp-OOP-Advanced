<h1>2.	Generic Box of Integer</h1>

>Create a generic class Box that can be initialized with any type and store the value.
 Override ToString() method method and print the type and stored value in format
  {class full name: value}. On the first line, you will get n - the number of integers
   to read from the console. On the next n lines, you will get the actual integers.
    For each of them create a box and call its ToString() method to print its data on
     the console.
